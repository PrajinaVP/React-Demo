React Getting Started

To use React in production, you need NPM and Node.js

## Install NMP and Node.js

# Setting up a React Environment
## Install create-react-app
npm install -g create-react-app

## Create a React Application
npx create-react-app demo-table 

## Run the React Application
Navigate to you project - cd demo-table
Run this command to run the React application
npm start


Set up mock API for testing UI
https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/react-mock-api
1. Create director 
mkdir json-mock-api
2. Navigate to your project's root directory.
cd json-mock-api
3. Create package.json
4. Install dependencies needed to create the mock API
npm install json-server --save
5. Create data for mock API
Create an src folder, and then within it, create a db.json file. Your file structure should look something like this:
json-mock-api/    
    node_modules/
    src/   
    	db.json
    package.json

The db.json file will act as your data source
6. Start your API
json-server --watch src/db.json
or
$ npx json-server --watch src/db.json
7. You should see your API running with an endpoint, http:/localhost:3000/employees


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
